## About

There is a `FreeBSD` kernel driver for a `bh1750` sensor.

<pre><code>
fdt_overlays="sun8i-h3-sid,sun8i-h3-ths<b>,sun8i-h3-bh1750-i2c0</b>"
</code></pre>

Now You can load the module and check its work:
```
kldload bh1750
sysctl dev.bh1750.0
```

## Status

The driver has been tested on "Raspberry Pi 2", "Orange Pi PC" and
"Orange Pi Zero" (sun8i-h2-plus-i2c0.dtbo is also needed).
During testing, two sensors with addresses 0x23 and 0x5ะก were used
simultaneously.
